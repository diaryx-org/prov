A *self-describing plaintext workspace*: a set of documents whose structure lives in the documents' own embedded metadata (frontmatter), not in the filesystem layout or an app-private sidecar folder.

The name says what it is: **prov** — *Plaintext Records, Organized & Verifiable* — and, not by accident, the usual short form of *provenance*. A prov workspace is one you can hand to any tool and it explains itself: follow the links in the metadata and the whole structure unfolds, with a distinguished root that describes the whole.

## Layout

- **`prov/`** — the library. Documents, relations, identity, and the workspace seam.
- **`prov-cli/`** — a thin command-line companion (the installed binary is `prov`).

## Filesystem

prov is generic over the small async [`prov::Storage`](prov/src/fs.rs) trait, which mirrors the slice of `std::fs` the scan/traverse/mutate engine needs. Implement it over `std::fs`, `tokio::fs`, or a browser filesystem (OPFS/IndexedDB) — the workspace never learns which.

## Status

Works for simple workspaces.

Working toward 1.0 now that Twig (Zig dependency) has reached 1.0.
