//! Validation — integrity findings over the workspace graph, from a root.
//!
//! The sleeper feature (DESIGN §8): walk the spanning tree and report every
//! violated invariant as a [`Finding`] — data, not a panic.
//!
//! Underneath sits the **census** ([`Workspace::census`]): one traversal that
//! yields every forward link reachable from the root — frontmatter relation
//! edges *and* body `[[…]]` wikilinks alike — each tagged with where it is
//! written ([`LinkSite`]) and how it resolves ([`Resolution`]). Because it is
//! read straight from the documents, the census is *ground truth*; the backlink
//! map, these findings, and (in `mutate`) inbound-rename maintenance are all
//! views over it, and any stored index heals toward it. [`Workspace::check`] is
//! the findings view. The checks:
//!
//! - **broken link** — a path target (in a relation or a wikilink) that
//!   resolves to nothing on disk;
//! - **case mismatch** — a target that only resolves because the filesystem is
//!   case-insensitive (`docs/design.md` vs `docs/DESIGN.md`): works on macOS,
//!   breaks on Linux. Caught by comparing exact directory listings;
//! - **cycle / duplicate containment** — a spanning target already visited
//!   (the spanning relation must be a single-parent tree);
//! - **missing inverse** — a spanning child whose inverse field (`part_of`)
//!   does not point back at its parent;
//! - **malformed / dangling ID** — a `colophon:<id>` reference (in a relation
//!   or a wikilink) that fails its check character, or that no live registry
//!   entry resolves;
//! - **unreadable** — a document that exists but cannot be read or parsed.
//!
//! External targets (URLs, `mailto:`) are never checked. Autofix comes with
//! the mutation layer's growth; findings first.
