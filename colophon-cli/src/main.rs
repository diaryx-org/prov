//! `colophon` — command-line companion for the colophon library.
//!
//! A thin adapter: parse arguments, call into the library, render the result.
//! All logic lives in `colophon`; this crate is I/O and presentation only.
//!
//! Single-document commands (`show`, `links`, `meta`, `get`, `body`, `set`,
//! `unset`) operate on the pure layers. Workspace commands (`tree`, `check`,
//! `new`, `mv`, `rm`) drive the library's [`colophon::StdFs`]-backed engine,
//! rooted at the current directory, through the dependency-free
//! [`colophon::block_on`] executor.
