//! Attachments — giving an *arbitrary* file its own workspace-linked metadata.
//!
//! A prov document carries its structure in embedded frontmatter, but a
//! binary — an image, a PDF, a font — cannot. The fix reuses the **separated**
//! document shape (`EmbedStyle::Separate`): a whole-file metadata *sidecar*
//! joined to a body file by a `content` attribute. An attachment is that same
//! pattern with the body relaxed from prose to bytes — the sidecar
//! `photo.jpg.yaml` holds `title`/`id`/relations and points `content` at
//! `photo.jpg`, which prov links, moves, and validates but never *reads*.
//!
//! This is the sidecar prov's philosophy welcomes, not the one it rejects:
//! a co-located, visible, self-describing document any tool can open — the exact
//! opposite of an app-private `.obsidian/`-style folder (`lib.rs`).
//!
//! Three operations:
//! - [`attach`](Workspace::attach) — mint a sidecar for a loose file and link it
//!   under a parent (the attachment analogue of [`create`](Workspace::create)).
//! - [`attachment_for`](Workspace::attachment_for) — the reverse lookup: given a
//!   payload, find its sidecar by the `<file>.<ext>` convention, confirmed by the
//!   authoritative `content` pointer.
//! - [`loose_attachments`](Workspace::loose_attachments) — every opaque file with
//!   no sidecar yet, the work-list an importer walks.
//!
//! Opacity is a *role*, not a format. A file prov can read is refused by
//! `attach` — it can carry its own metadata, so it should — but
//! [`attach_opaque`](Workspace::attach_opaque) waives that for a specimen: an
//! example document whose metadata block is an exhibit rather than a claim about
//! this workspace. The sidecar's `attachment: true` marker is what shadows it,
//! and [`is_shadowed_payload`](Workspace::is_shadowed_payload) is what holds prov
//! to it in the scans that would otherwise read the file.
//!
//! Move and delete need no new code: a sidecar is a separated node, so
//! [`rename`](Workspace::rename) already relocates the payload beside it (keeping
//! `content` correct) and [`delete`](Workspace::delete) removes the pair.
