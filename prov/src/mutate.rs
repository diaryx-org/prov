//! Mutation with link maintenance — the crate's hard, valuable half.
//!
//! Creating, moving, and deleting a document are never single-file operations
//! in a linked workspace: the spanning relation and its inverse live in *other*
//! documents, and every touched link must keep pointing at the truth. Each op
//! here computes the full set of affected documents, edits their metadata with
//! fig's comment-preserving [`fig::Embed`] editor (byte-minimal diffs, fence
//! style and format untouched, labels on `[label](path)` links kept), and only
//! then touches the filesystem.
//!
//! ## Identity is additive here (DESIGN §4)
//!
//! Everything below operates on paths and never *requires* an ID. When a
//! registry is present, each op additionally keeps it true — create registers
//! (if the policy's `on_create` fires), rename updates `id → path`, delete
//! tombstones — and a `colophon:<id>` entry in another document's metadata is
//! deliberately **not** rewritten by a move: the registry update is what keeps
//! it resolving, which is the entire point of linking by ID. With
//! [`crate::identity::NoIdentity`]/[`crate::index::NoIndex`] these hooks
//! monomorphize to nothing.
//!
//! The vocabulary is never hardcoded: the spanning relation and its inverse
//! come from the workspace's [`crate::relation::RelationSet`].
//!
//! ## Writes are staged, not issued
//!
//! Every op here computes its edits and stages them into a
//! [`ChangeSet`](crate::change::ChangeSet), which lands as one unit — documents
//! and, when the op moved an ID, the registry with them. No error can leave the
//! workspace half-linked, and behind the write-ahead journal
//! ([`crate::journal`]) no crash can either: an interrupted op resolves to the
//! workspace fully before it or fully after it. Ops remain documents-only: no
//! directory moves.
