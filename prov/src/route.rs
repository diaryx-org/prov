//! Routes — addressing a node by its path *through the containment tree*, and
//! materializing the segments that do not exist yet.
//!
//! A path (`Daily/2026/2026_index.md`) addresses a file; a **route**
//! (`Daily/2026/2026-07`) addresses a node by walking the spanning relation from
//! a start document, matching each segment against a child's **title**. The two
//! are deliberately separate surfaces: containment here is link-shaped, not
//! directory-shaped (DESIGN §3), so a route is a fact about the *tree* and may
//! cross directories — or not touch them at all.
//!
//! The motivating friction is the recurring-entry workflow: a daily note under
//! `Daily/2026/2026-07` needs its month node to exist, and on the first of the
//! month it does not. Naming the route and asking for missing segments to be
//! created is `mkdir -p` for the containment tree — the one part of that workflow
//! a shell alias cannot express, since it means finding-or-creating nodes and
//! linking them in both directions. Everything else (what a date *is*, how it is
//! formatted) stays in the shell, where it is the user's business and not the
//! workspace's (DESIGN §2: opinionated mechanism, flexible vocabulary).
//!
//! The work splits in two so a caller can preview before it writes, exactly as
//! [`plan_mirror`](Workspace::plan_mirror) does: [`Workspace::plan_route`] walks
//! and returns a [`RoutePlan`] without touching disk;
//! [`Workspace::apply_route`] realizes it, reusing
//! [`create`](Workspace::create) for each synthesized node. The plan is also
//! where policy lives: it *reports* what is missing rather than deciding whether
//! that is allowed, so a caller without `--parents` can refuse it and a caller
//! with `--dry-run` can print it.
//!
//! ## Resolution is bounded
//!
//! Matching a segment reads one node's spanning children and their titles — never
//! a workspace-wide scan. This looks like it should trip the alias-addressed
//! spanning hazard (DESIGN §8, where descending an alias-addressed tree needs
//! every title up front), but it does not: a route descends from a *known* node
//! one segment at a time, so only the children of the nodes actually on the route
//! are ever read. Those are index nodes, which are small.
